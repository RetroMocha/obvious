# Obvious

Obvious is an architecture framework. The goal is to provide architectural
structure for a highly testable system that is obvious to understand and where
both the front end UI and back end infrastructure are treated as implementation
details independent of the app logic itself.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'obvious'

And then execute:

    $ bundle
